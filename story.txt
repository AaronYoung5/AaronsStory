Once upon a time, a man came to the University of Wisconsin - Madison. The man, who went by Tim, was very happy, as this was his favorite university. After a year or so, he realized he didn't like it and decided to transfer.

Unfortunaty Tim wasn't sure if about his decision, and tried to get help to better understand what he was really looking for. That's when he met Alicia.
